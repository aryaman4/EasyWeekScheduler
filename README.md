# EasyWeek
Schedule generating and optimizing app for UofI students which allows for students to make their schedule by providing minimal data like registration year/semester and courses already taken. The generated schedule takes into account time conflicts, pre-requisites and required technical courses for a major. 

###Getting Started
The app uses the CIS Course Explorer API to get live course data from the UIUC system and chooses classes/sections accordingly.
Please read the documentation here [https://courses.illinois.edu/cisdocs/explorer]

We have used Flask with Python as the back-end framework and React for the front-end.
Read Flask documentation here [http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/]

Read the contributing guide for further details on how the workflow for the project is.
